		<p>
			I graduated from Purdue University with a bachelor's degree in
			chemical engineering. I started with ADM in June of 2017 where I
			started as a production engineer. Within one and half years, I was
			promoted to the role of a process engineer. I left ADM to pursue a
			role within operations management as a Process Lead at Ingredion.
			After one year in that role, I was promoted to Department Manager of
			the Corn Co-products department. A little over a year later, I'm
			transitioning to a senior engineer role. While I've learned and
			accomplished so much in the manufacturing role, I've realized that I
			enjoy computer programming so much more than what I learned with my
			original degree. Transitioning to a senior engineer will allow me to
			continue to provide value to Ingredion while I develop a software
			engineering skillset.
